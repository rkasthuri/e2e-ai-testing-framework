# ADR-013: Credential Resolution Policy — ExecutionContext as Credential Provider

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-07-10

## Context
The TD-UI-002 live smoke ran a SauceDemo form-login crawl **unauthenticated** and
discovered **0 pages** (root-cause audit, commit `13643aa`). Causes:
- No env→config bridge: nothing established the credentials the engine needs.
- The crawl fell back to the **repo tree** (`WorkspaceResolver` cwd fallback,
  `C:\forge-framework\.forge\config.json`) — a credential-less config.
- `ConfigAdapter.ts:96–99` logs `UNAUTHENTICATED` as a **non-fatal warning**, so a
  misconfigured crawl silently produces empty results.
- The engine re-persists `config.json` on every bootstrap (`CrawlRunner.ts:296`,
  gated by `:94` `!config || options.force`) via the engine `AppConfig` shape,
  which **strips** any forge-ui fields written into `config.json` (Phase 0 finding).

## Decision

### Sidecar, not config.json
Credential **references** live in a forge-ui-owned **sidecar**:
`~/.forge-projects/<app>/.forge/credentials.json` → `{ schemaVersion: 1, usernameEnv, passwordEnv }`.
The **engine never reads or writes** this file, so the bootstrap `saveConfig`
rewrite (`CrawlRunner.ts:296`) can never strip it.

We do **NOT** write credential fields into `config.json`, and we do **NOT**
maintain a forge-ui "legacy envKey" on disk. The only `credentials.envKey` that
ever appears on disk is the one the **engine's own Bootstrap** writes
(`Bootstrap.ts:462`) during a bootstrap — that is engine behavior we do not touch.

### Reference vs Material seam
- `CredentialReference { usernameEnv, passwordEnv }` — env-var **names**, the only
  persisted shape (sidecar).
- `CredentialMaterial { username, password }` — the **values**, created only
  in-memory by the resolver / ExecutionContext, never written to disk.
- The engine sees neither type. ExecutionContext translates material down to the
  engine's **existing** credential input (two-path injection below).

### CredentialResolver hierarchy
- `CredentialResolver` (abstract): `resolve(appName): CredentialMaterial` +
  `assertPresent(authType, reference)`.
- `EnvCredentialResolver` (Phase 1 concrete): reads the sidecar reference (default
  `<APP>_USERNAME` / `<APP>_PASSWORD`), materializes from `process.env`, and
  hard-fails when `authType !== 'none'` and the pair is unresolved.
- Future resolvers (OS keychain — TD-UI-009; cloud secrets — Phase 2) implement the
  same abstract contract without touching callers.

### Two-path injection (engine untouched)
ExecutionContext orchestrates; the engine's own machinery is reused per path:

- **Path A — bootstrap (force / fresh / Onboard `force:true`):** pass the material
  as `options.username` / `options.password`. The engine's `Bootstrap` writes its
  own `credentials.envKey` block (`Bootstrap.ts:462`, e.g. `USER_CREDENTIALS`),
  persists it (`saveConfig:296`), and `CrawlRunner.ts:129` injects
  `process.env[thatEnvKey] = user:pass`. AuthManager reads it. ExecutionContext
  only supplies options — the engine does the rest.
- **Path B — non-bootstrap re-crawl (existing config, no force):** the engine does
  not touch credentials. ExecutionContext reads the **existing**
  `config.credentials.envKey` from `config.json` (written by a prior bootstrap),
  materializes from the sidecar, and sets `process.env[thatEnvKey] = user:pass`
  **itself**. `options.username/password` are **not** passed, so `CrawlRunner:129`
  stays **inert** — a single materializer, no double-inject.

`CrawlRunner:129`'s value is always the operator's real `user:pass`, so neither
path can inject a wrong/placeholder value (Phase 0 (b)).

### Hard-fail is pre-flight
Missing credentials for an auth-required `authType` → a typed `CredentialError`
thrown by the resolver **before** the engine runs. JobRunner catches it → appends
the message to the Mission Timeline (`logBuffer`) + sets `status: 'failed'` /
`error`. Not the engine's silent `console.warn`.

### Workspace provisioned before any config write
`~/.forge-projects/<app>` is created (with its sidecar) **before** the bootstrap
config write — never the repo tree. `WorkspaceResolver` provisions the per-app dir
instead of falling back to cwd.

### Engine invariant
`src/` gets **zero** edits. Every consumer above is forge-ui. If any future phase
forces a `src/` change, stop and escalate.

## Open edge (flagged, Phase 3+)
Path B needs `config.credentials.envKey` on disk, which only a prior bootstrap
writes. An app onboarded **without** credentials (then given env vars later) has no
such key → a non-force re-crawl cannot inject. Resolution (deferred): when
`authType` requires auth, the sidecar+env resolve, but `config.credentials.envKey`
is absent, ExecutionContext re-triggers a bootstrap (Path A) to establish it.

## Consequences
- No engine edits; forge-ui-only new files + edits.
- Credential references survive engine `config.json` rewrites (sidecar isolation).
- Migration: fixtures + Onboard write sidecars with default-derived names; existing
  `config.json` files stay intact.
- Onboard: default-derived pointer names now; custom override later (TD-UI-001).

## Alternatives rejected
- **Write pointers into `config.json`** — stripped by `saveConfig:296` on every
  bootstrap/Onboard (Phase 0 (a)).
- **Maintain a forge-ui legacy `envKey` on disk** — redundant with the engine's own
  Bootstrap-written key; two writers of the same field invite drift.
- **Engine-side role synthesis** (edit `ConfigAdapter`/`CrawlRunner`) — violates the
  zero-engine-edit invariant.

## Canonical v2 clarification - 2026-08-13

[`ADR-028`](ADR-028-canonical-test-definition-v2-and-execution-authority.md)
separates authentication expectation from credential availability and
authentication execution result. A v2 Definition may persist only the
expectation and its safe governed declaration digest. Credential references and
material remain runtime preflight inputs, and execution outcomes remain
Run/Result evidence. Declared configuration is not an Observation.

## Implementation note — 2026-08-11 (TD-SEC-001)

The original two-path environment-injection design above is preserved as
decision-time history but is no longer current runtime behavior. Repository
evidence showed that both paths made credential material process-global and did
not restore the injected values. The write-only browser storage-state artifact
also retained cookies/tokens without any consumer or governed retention owner.

Current behavior is:

- `EnvCredentialResolver` resolves availability and returns a governed
  `CredentialReference` only. It no longer returns credential values.
- `CredentialExecutionScope` is the single runtime materializer. It resolves a
  reference or accepts directly submitted operation material, exposes a
  read-only view only inside an awaited callback, and disposes the holder in
  `finally` on success, failure, cancellation-shaped return, or thrown error.
- Product execution and crawl/onboarding both use that scope. FORGE no longer
  writes credential values to `process.env`; source environment variables remain
  operator-owned inputs and are never modified by an operation.
- Playwright browser contexts are ephemeral and are closed in `finally`.
  Storage state, cookies, and tokens are not serialized by Product execution or
  onboarding crawl. New role projections therefore record
  `storageStatePath: null`; historical model rows remain unchanged.
- Credential refusal, engine failure, persistence, logs, and Product APIs expose
  allowlisted reason codes/messages only. Credential variable names, values,
  browser exceptions, and URL query/fragment material are withheld.

JavaScript cannot prove physical heap zeroization. The enforceable guarantee is
that FORGE clears its live holder, makes retained views fail closed, drops
operation references, clears submitted request/job fields, and creates no
durable credential-bearing artifact. This limitation is explicit rather than a
claim that the runtime can erase immutable strings from the VM heap.
